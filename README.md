# Sentiment Analysis with DistilBERT Transformer ü§ñüìù

Welcome to the sentiment analysis project powered by Hugging Face's DistilBERT model! This project demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis on text using a pre-trained DistilBERT model for sequence classification.

## üåü Key Features

- **DistilBERT Transformer Model:** Utilizes the DistilBERT model from Hugging Face's Transformers library for efficient text classification.
- **DistilBERTTokenizer:** Tokenizes text input to prepare it for model inference.
- **DistilBertForSequenceClassification:** Fine-tuned model for sentiment analysis, predicting sentiment labels for input text.
- **Streamlit Web App:** Integrates the sentiment analysis model into a user-friendly web interface using Streamlit.
-  **Binary Classification:** Predicts sentiment as either positive (1) or negative (0) based on input text.

This tool provides users with a quick and accurate way to analyze the sentiment of text inputs, making it suitable for various applications, including customer feedback analysis and social media sentiment monitoring.
